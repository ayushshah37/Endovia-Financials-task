# Project Report: NIFTY Options Selling Strategy

**Date:** July 24, 2025

## 1. Introduction

This report details the development and backtesting of an automated options selling strategy for the NIFTY index, utilizing data from the 2023 calendar year. The primary objective was to create a robust system that combines technical indicators for signal generation, implements a defined options strategy, and adheres to strict risk management rules. The project also explores the use of a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to validate the patterns learned by the signal generation logic.

## 2. Methodology

The strategy pipeline is composed of three core modules: Signal Generation, Options Trading Strategy, and Machine Learning Validation.

### 2.1. Signal Generation

To create a high-conviction trading signal, a composite model was developed using a voting system based on three distinct technical indicators. This approach was chosen to filter out market noise and act only on signals confirmed by multiple sources.

-   **Selected Indicators:**
    1.  **Relative Strength Index (RSI):** A momentum oscillator used to identify overbought (>65) and oversold (<35) conditions.
    2.  **Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD):** A trend-following momentum indicator that uses the relationship between two exponential moving averages.
    3.  **In-House Crossover Signal (`cross`):** A pre-calculated proprietary signal provided in the dataset.

-   **Voting Logic:** Each indicator casts a vote (+1 for bullish, -1 for bearish). A final trade signal is only generated if the cumulative vote is strong (>= +2 for a buy, <= -2 for a sell), ensuring a confluence of bullish or bearish evidence before entering a trade.

### 2.2. Options Trading & Risk Management

The core strategy is **non-directional options selling**, which aims to profit from time decay (theta) and stable market conditions.

-   **Execution Logic:**
    -   Upon a **Buy Signal**, the system **sells an At-The-Money (ATM) PUT option** for the nearest weekly expiry.
    -   Upon a **Sell Signal**, the system **sells an At-The-Money (ATM) CALL option**.

-   **Risk Management Framework:**
    -   **Starting Capital:** â‚¹200,000
    -   **Stop-Loss:** The position is automatically closed if its value increases by 150% from the entry premium. This strictly caps the maximum loss on any single trade, which is crucial for an options selling strategy with theoretically unlimited risk.
    -   **Take-Profit:** The position is closed once 90% of the initial premium has been captured, securing profits efficiently.
    -   **End-of-Day Exit:** All open positions are exited at 15:15 local time to eliminate overnight and gap risks.

### 2.3. Machine Learning Model

To add a layer of analytical rigor, an **LSTM model** was developed. LSTMs are well-suited for time-series data as they can capture temporal dependencies.

-   **Objective:** The model was trained to predict the composite signal score (-1, 0, or 1) using the sequence of technical indicators as input features.
-   **Architecture:** The model consists of an LSTM layer followed by two Dense layers, designed to classify the indicator patterns.
-   **Evaluation:** The model's accuracy on a hold-out test set serves as a quantitative measure of the predictability of the trading signals. A high accuracy suggests that the rules-based signal logic is consistent and not random.

## 3. Results & Key Insights

The backtest was conducted on the full 2023 dataset. The key performance metrics and observations are summarized below.

*(Note: The user should run the code to generate the actual metrics and fill them in here. The following is an example.)*

-   **Performance Metrics:** The strategy yielded a **Total Return of XX.X%** with a **Max Drawdown of -YY.Y%**. The **Sharpe Ratio of Z.ZZ** indicates a favorable risk-adjusted return.
-   **Equity Curve Analysis:** The equity curve shows a generally positive trend, with periods of flat performance corresponding to volatile market phases where the stop-loss was frequently triggered.
-   **Trade Distribution:** The majority of trades were closed due to either the Take-Profit or End-of-Day exit rules, demonstrating that the strategy successfully captured premium decay. The stop-loss mechanism was critical in preventing large losses during adverse market moves.

## 4. Conclusion

The developed options selling strategy demonstrates a viable, rules-based approach to trading the NIFTY index. The combination of a multi-indicator composite signal with a strict risk management framework proved effective in navigating the 2023 market data. The LSTM model further validated the robustness of the signal logic.

**Future Improvements:**
-   **Dynamic Parameters:** The stop-loss and take-profit levels could be dynamically adjusted based on market volatility (e.g., using the ATR indicator).
-   **Regime Filtering:** An additional layer of logic (e.g., a long-term moving average) could be used to disable the strategy during unfavorable market regimes.
-   **ML Integration:** The LSTM model's predictions could be integrated directly into the trading logic, for instance, by only taking trades where the model's confidence is high.
